Hi!


We experimented in the ipython notebooks on Google colab. The .py files contain the same as python scripts.

Baselines Final - Contains data preprocessing, feature engineering and baseline model experimentation

Neural Models Final - Contains data preprocessing, feature engineering and neural model experimentation

EDA - Contains exploratory data analysis


Thank you for the wonderful lectures!
